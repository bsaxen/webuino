<h2>Simuino Version 0.0.1</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simuino is a tool for running Arduino sketches. Arduino UNO/MEGA Pin Simulator. Run your sketch and evaluate in/out status of the digital and analog pins. The GUI is based on ncurses, i.e. run Simuino from a terminal window. It is also possible to construct scenarios regarding analogRead, digitalRead and External Interrupts. The purpose is to make the construction of a sketch easier. You can verify the functionality without having the Arduino board available. Simuino runs the sketch and shows the status of the digital,analog pins and serial output.</p>
